            <p id="story-text">	You awaken to the scent of damp stone and aged wood, the air heavy with silence. A faint flicker of candlelight dances on the cathedral walls, illuminating intricate carvings that twist and coil like the shadows of your thoughts. As your senses begin to sharpen,
                you shift slightly, the rough stone of the altar pressing into your back. A chill courses through you, more than the cold of the stone; it’s a disquieting void that gnaws at the edges of your consciousness. 
                Confusion swirls within you like the smoke curling from the flickering candles, casting ghostly shadows that flit across the room and seem to whisper secrets just beyond your grasp.
            You force yourself to sit up, the damp chill of the air clinging to your skin like a shroud. The flickering light reveals the altar draped in tattered cloth, stained with age and something darker, something that sends a shiver down your spine </p>
