        [Upon stepping out of the cathedral, the heavy scent of incense still clinging to the air like a ghost, you find yourself face to face 
        with a young priest. His smile, bright and almost unnervingly wide, contrasts sharply with the darkness that lingers in your mind. 
        As he approaches, the weight of his gaze feels both inviting and intrusive, as if he can peer into the shadows that haunt you. The 
        cloistered silence of the cathedral seems to fade away, replaced by the soft rustle of his robes and the eerie echo of distant footsteps,
         as if the very walls are holding their breath, waiting for an interaction they’ve long been deprived of. ]
    </div>
    <div id="dialogue2" class="dialogue-box">
        "Ah! You're awake! Come, speak with me for a moment. You carry such exquisite pain, I simply wish to....divide you from it. 
        I have harvested your soul and used its power in the creaton of four monsters which now each hold their own version of the contract needed
        to have your soul returned to you. "
    </div>
    <div id="dialogue3" class="dialogue-box">
        "Only one sacred contract holds the power to reclaim your soul. However, the path to redemption is fraught with peril; you must carefully
         select from the myriad of items scattered throughout each treacherous area. Be warned—each monstrous foe has its own weaknesses, and not 
         every weapon will strike true against them. You are permitted to carry only two weapons at a time, so choose wisely and with purpose. When 
         you have secured your two chosen items, return to this very spot. We shall see if you possess the courage and skill to earn back your lost soul. "
